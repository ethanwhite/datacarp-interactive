### Introduction to tabular data

* We will be working with data from the Portal Project.
* Long-term experimental study of small mammals in Arizona.

### Packages

* Main way that reusable code is shared in R
* Combination of code, data, and documentation
* R has a rich ecosystem of packages for data manipulation & analysis
* We've already installed the packages for this demo
* Even if we've installed a package it is automatically available to do analysis with
* This because different packages may have functions with the same names
* So don't want to have to worry about all of the packages we've installed every time we right a piece of code
* Load all of the functions in the package:

```{webr-r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ratdat)
```

#### Loading and viewing the dataset

* Data on small mammal surveys is available from `ratdat` in the `surveys` data frame

```{webr-r}
head(surveys)
```

### Basic `dplyr`

* Modern data manipulation library for R

#### Select

* Select a subset of columns.

```{webr-r}
select(surveys, year, month, day)
```

* They can occur in any order.

```{webr-r}
select(surveys, month, day, year)
```

#### Mutate

* Add new columns with calculated values using `mutate()`

```{webr-r}
mutate(surveys, hindfoot_length_cm = hindfoot_length / 10)
```

* If we look at `surveys` now will it contain the new column?
* *Open `surveys`*
* All of these commands produce new values, data frames in this case
* To store them for later use we need to assign them to a variable

```{webr-r}
surveys_plus <- mutate(surveys,
                       hindfoot_length_cm = hindfoot_length / 10)
```

* Or we could overwrite the existing variable if we don't need it

```{webr-r}
surveys <- mutate(surveys,
                  hindfoot_length_cm = hindfoot_length / 10)
```

#### Arrange

* We can sort the data in the table using `arrange`
* To sort the surveys table by by weight

```{webr-r}
arrange(surveys, weight)
```

* We can reverse the order of the sort by "wrapping" `weight` in another function, `desc` for "descending

```{webr-r}
arrange(surveys, desc(weight))
```

* We can also sort by multiple columns, so if we wanted to sort first by `plot_id` and then by date

```{webr-r}
arrange(surveys, plot_id, year, month, day)
```

#### Filter 

* Use `filter()` to get only the rows that meet certain criteria.
* Combine the data frame to be filtered with a series of conditional statements.
* Column, condition, value
* To filter the data frame to only keep the data on species `DS`
    * Type the name of the function, `filter`
    * Parentheses
    * The name of the data frame we want to filter, `surveys`
    * The column the want to filter on, `species_id`
    * The condition, which is `==` for "is equal to"
    * And then the value, `"DS"`
    * `DS` here is a string, not a variable or a column name, so we enclose it in quotation marks
  
```{webr-r}
filter(surveys, species_id == "DS")
```

* Like with vectors we can have a condition that is "not equal to" using "!="
* So if we wanted the data for all species except "DS

```{webr-r}
filter(surveys, species_id != "DS")
```

* We can also filter on multiple conditions at once
* In computing we combine conditions in two ways "and" & "or"
* "and" means that all of the conditions must be true
* Do this in `dplyr` using additional comma separate arguments
* So, to get the data on species "DS" for the year 1995:

```{webr-r}
filter(surveys, species_id == "DS", year > 1995)
```

* Alternatively we can use the `&` symbol, which stands for "and"

```{webr-r}
filter(surveys, species_id == "DS" & year > 1995)
```

* This approach is mostly useful for building more complex conditions

* "or" means that one or more of the conditions must be true
* Do this using `|`
* To get data on all of the *Dipodomys* species

```{webr-r}
filter(surveys, species_id == "DS" | species_id == "DM" | species_id == "DO")
```

### Filtering null values

* One of the common tasks we use `filter` for is removing null values from data
* Based on what we learned before it's natural to think that we do this by using the condition `weight != NA`

```{webr-r}
filter(surveys, weight != NA)
```

* Why didn't that work?
* Null values like `NA` are special
* We don't want to accidentally say that two "missing" things are the same
    * We don't know if they are
* So use special commands
* `is.na()` checks if the value is `NA`
* So if we wanted all of the data where the weigh is `NA`

```{webr-r}
filter(surveys, is.na(weight))
```

* We'll learn more about why this works in the same way as the other conditional statements when we study conditionals in detail later in the course

* To remove null values we combine this with `!` for "not"

```{webr-r}
filter(surveys, !is.na(weight))
```

* So `!is.na(weight)` is conceptually the same as "weight != NA"
* It is common to combine a null filter with other conditions using "and"
* For example we might want all of the data on a species that contains weights

```{webr-r}
filter(surveys, species_id == "DS", !is.na(weight))
```
