This is done using square brackets []. In general [] in R means, “give me a piece of something”.\nIf we put one number in the brackets it will us the value that position:\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\nTry changing this to get the values at different positions.\nIf we use two numbers separated by a colon this will give us all the values in the range of those numbers. For 1:3 will use us the first through third values.\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:3 works by makeing a vector of the whole numbers 1 through 3.\nSo, this is the same as states[1:3] is the same as states[c(1, 2, 3)]\nYou can use a vector to get any subset or order you want states[c(4, 1, 3)]\nMany functions in R take a vector as input and return a value\nThis includes the function length which determines how many items are in a vector\n\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also calculate common summary statistics\nFor example, if we have a vector of population counts\n\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Basic Vectors.\n\n\n\nNull values\n\nSo far we’ve worked with vectors that contain no missing values\nBut most real world data has values that are missing for a variety of reasons\nFor example, kangaroo rats don’t like being caught by humans and are pretty good at escaping before you’ve finished measuring them\nMissing values, known as “null” values, are written in R as NA with no quotes, which is short for “not available”\nSo a vector of 4 population counts with the third value missing would look like\n\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we try to take the mean of this vector we get NA?\n\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHard to say what a calculation including NA should be\nSo most calculations return NA when NA is in the data\nCan tell many functions to remove the NA before calculating\nDo this using an optional argument, which is an argument that we don’t have to include unless we want to modify the default behavior of the function\nAdd optional arguments by providing their name (na.rm), =, and the value that we want those arguments to take (TRUE)\n\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Nulls in Vectors.\n\n\n\nWorking with multiple vectors\n\nBuild on example where we have information on states and population counts by adding areas\n\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector math\n\nWe can divide the count vector by the area vector to get a vector of the density of individuals in that area\n\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis works because when we divide vectors, R divides the first value in the first vector by the first value in the second vector, then divides the second values in each vector, and so on\nElement-wise: operating on one element at a time\n\n\n\nFiltering\n\nSubsetting or “filtering” is done using []\nLike with slicing, the [] say “give me a piece of something”\nSelects parts of vectors based on “conditions” not position\nGet the density values in site a\n\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== is how we indicate “equal to” in most programming languages.\nNot =. = is used for assignment.\nCan also do “not equal to”\n\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerical comparisons like greater or less than\nSelect states that meet with some restrictions on density\n\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan subset a vector based on itself\nIf we want to look at the densities greater than 3\ndensity is both the vector being subset and part of the condition\n\n\nLoading webR...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple vectors can be used together to perform element-wise math, where we do the same calculation for each position in the vectors\nWe can also filter the values in vector based on the values in another vector or itself\n\n\nDo Shrub Volume Vectors 1-3."
